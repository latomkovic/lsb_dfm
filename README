# Files

derived
  Data/files derived from other inputs, but not part of a specific run.
  Currently only used for a shapefile generated from the grid.
  
inputs-static
  Files which do not change across runs, are not derived, but are instead
  referenced directly from the MDU or other parts of the model setup.
  
nudged_features.pli
  A Delft-style polyline file defining locations of sources.  This is created
  by exporting boundary condition features from Delta Shell.
  
write_grid_shp.py
  Short script which writes the shapefile for grid edges, used for loading
  grid representation into GIS.
  
runs
  Script-generated simulation setups are in subdirectories below here.
  
sample_run_dfm
  Not currently used.  Reference for how to start multiprocessor runs.
  
sfbay_freshwater
sfbay_potw
  Git submodules holding forcing data for rivers and wastewater discharges.
  
sfb_dfm.py
  Main script for generating new runs.
  
sfei_v19_net.nc
  Grid
  
template.mdu
  Template model definition.  Settings which needn't be set dynamically can
  be set here.  Can be tweaked in sfb_dfm.py
  
update_alviso_bathy.py
plot_sources.py
  Temporary dev-related scripts for troubleshooting some issues.  Probably
  will be removed down the road.
